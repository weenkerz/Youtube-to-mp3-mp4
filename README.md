I'm gonna be honest I still don't really know what commiting is. I think I have commitment issues.
Whatever...

This thingy does what you think it does. First you must select a directory, which it then saves to a txt file (I know theres probably a better way but I'm new to this), then you
input a youtube url and choose whether to download mp3 or mp4. It then downloads the audio/video to your selected directory.

There are probabaly a lot of problems with this program, but I'm proud of the fact that it functions at all. :)
